# Exploratory Data Analysis 
High-Risk Companies -
Here We Got a Record of four Companies in this investment profile. These Companies have Low Market Capital and their Dividend/share is also low. Here Delta Value for only one company named ‘Greaves Cotton Limited’ > 30 % means gave a good return last year, but the dividend/share price was very low, so cumulatively customers are not able to get more profit from this company although the return is high

Moderate Risk Companies -
Here we see that Market Capital (Cr) & Dividend /Share increased as Risk is Reduced . from this we can say that these companies are quite stable in their Revenue  and Market Capital, So they give Higher Dividends per share than Risk taking companies. Here Delta Value ( which shows % of return on share for last year ) for out of five four companies > 30 %,  we can say that in last year these companies gave Good return.

Low-Risk Companies -
Here We can see that Market Capital & Dividend/share  is very Higher. But Dellta's value ( which shows % of return on share for last year ) is quite low, so for this investment profile companies customer get less return than moderate profile companies

# Challenges And Learnings
- Some challenges we faced at connecting the  spreadsheet  & updating data from Jupiter notebook to Google sheet  at that  time but we all worked together, explore various resources to find solutions  and solved the problem.
- We learned team management from this project.
- We analyze the data using Python Libraries and then export the data from  Google Sheets to Jupyter.
- First, we analyze the data from the spreadsheet and then make the best insights and work on those insights.
- After that, we wrote the queries and found the data on jupyter notebook and then make the best insights and work on those data..
